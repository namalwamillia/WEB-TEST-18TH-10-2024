    <p>Dear Madam Haddijjah</p>

    <p>
        As you begin your journey abroad, I want to express my deepest gratitude for being an incredible lecturer. 
        Your passion, dedication, and care have made a lasting impact on my life, and I feel truly fortunate to have 
        been your student. You've inspired me to grow and made learning an enriching experience, and I will miss you dearly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please know that I will always remember the bond we shared and the lessons youâ€™ve taught me. 
        I hope you find happiness and success in all that lies ahead, and I humbly ask that you never forget me.
    </p>

    <p>With love and appreciation,<br>
